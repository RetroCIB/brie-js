brie-js
=======

My implementation of a Trie structure. Probably not the best and definitely not the only one, but a good learning opportunity for me.

Version 1.0 beta

Usage
=====
You can see a sample usage of this function inside the index.html file

Helpers
=======
The GIT repo contains a small Python helper script as well, used to parse text list with words and turn them into a javascript dictionary

Credits
=======
The trie algorithms were based on a post written by Steve Hanov.

The list of english words used for the demo dictionary was taken from SIL International
